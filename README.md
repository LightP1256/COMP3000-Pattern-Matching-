## Project Title
### Pattern matching support for those with Dyslexia

## Project Vision
This Project is for anyone with Dyslexia that would like to get help or learn pattern matching which is a very important aspect of coding. In general, having a product that would help anyone to pattern match would be helpful being there isn’t many products that do help in this category. With the focus is to help people with Dyslexia which can find it hard to understand to begin with but tends to excel further. 

The project name is Pattern matching support for those with Dyslexia because this project title gives an understanding what the project entails. this project is a pattern matching website application that has user helpful interface with information stored on a database that will get interacted by an API to display information for interaction.

With that there isn’t really any website application that can provide this service which focus on support for those with Dyslexia which having this type of application could help lots of people to get a better understanding of pattern matching within coding because allowing more people to understand pattern matching more easily. This also benefits computational thinking towards understanding patterns within coding that helps the end user to build up on their knowledge and can be a start for someone new to coding.
